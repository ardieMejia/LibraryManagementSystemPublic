* stuff to add:
** just one extra view page for delete verification 
** 1 extra route to re-route to:
*** public function verifydelete()
** a rather confusing bit, that still requires lots of reading...
*** add deleteAll() to parent model
** Add results-per-page to author and category
** After deleting the parent (categories and authors), and after verification, there should nice display of all books (child), deleted as well. Results per page is quite cumbersome... better deal with that later.




    public function destroy($id){

        $bookowner=Bookowner::find($id);
        $bookowner->deleteAll();

        return "book owner deleted (& his books hopefully)";
    }

    public function verifydelete($id){
        return view('misc/verifyaction',['id'=>$id]);

    }

// ------------------------------
    public function deleteAll(){

        $this->books()->delete();
        return parent::delete();
    }

// ------------------------------


// remember that every programmer is a retard
